# Laravel Commands

## Various Laravel commands for you to copy and paste

This is a collection of random Laravel commands I saved for later reference and to be used in various projects.

Since they are mostly unrelated to eachother there is no package for this, (though if a specific command becomes very popular I might package it).
Instead, it's intended that you copy them to your project. As such there is no backwards compatability promise as it's not intended that you update them,
instead you're fully free to just use the commands as starters and customize them as you see fit. Also, if you see a bug or have an improvement idea, please send a PR!
